# Notes
A note-taking app designed to make taking notes in class less of a pain. 

Compared to other note-taking apps which only allow text notes and pictures, this one allows importing of other documents as well: You can take photos of the board, as well as import PDFs / PPT slides or other handouts given out by the lecturer, so you can see all of it in one place. Notes are arranged in least-recent first order, so when you open the folder for a chapter, you see your notes in the order you took them, from the start of the chpter to the end.
